# 1.Basic List Operations:
#1.Write a Python program to create a list of 5 integers and print the sum of all elements in the list.
a=[1,2,3,4,5]
sum=0
for i in a:
    sum=sum+i
print(sum)

#2.Create a list of strings containing the names of 5 fruits. Access and print the second
# and fourth elements using indexing.
a=["mango","papaya","apple","cherry","grapes"]
print("second and fourth elements are:",a[2],a[4])
 
#3.Create a list of numbers from 1 to 10. Use slicing to print the first three numbers, the last three numbers,
#  and every second number in the list.
a=[1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10]
print("to print the first three numbers",a[:3])
print("to print the last three numbers",a[-3:])
print("every second number in the list.",a[::2])


#2. Adding and Removing Elements:
#1.Write a Python program that initializes a list with some numbers and:
l1=[1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8]
#.2.Adds a new number to the list using the append() method.
l1.append(5)
print(l1)
#3.Inserts a number at the second position using insert().
l1.insert(3,40)
print(l1)
#4.Extends the list with another list of numbers.
l2=[30,40,50]
l1.extend(l2)
print(l1)
#5.Remove all occurrences of the number 3 from a list of integers.
t1=[]
for i in l1:
    if i!=3:
        t1.append(i)
print(i)

#6.Write a Python program to remove the last element of a list using pop() and print the updated list.
l1.pop()
print(l1)
#Sorting and Reversing Lists:
#1.Write a Python program to sort a list of 10 random integers in
# ascending and descending order using sort() and reverse
s=[50,29,40,78,21,35,60]
s.sort()
print(s)
s.reverse()
print(s)

#2.Create a list of strings and reverse the order of elements using
#  both reverse() and slicing [::-1]. Compare the results.
a=["gopichand","srinivas","saikrishna","ram"]
c=a.copy()# with out changing the original list
c.reverse()
b=a[::-1]
print(c)
print(b)
print("both produces the same results")

#Aliasing and Cloning:
#1.Create a list of numbers. Assign the list to another variable and modify the original list.
# Check if the second list also changes. Then, create a copy of the original list and show that
# modifying the copy does not affect the original list.
l1=[10,20,30,40]
l2=l1
l1.append(50)
print(l1)
print(l2)
l3=list(l1)
l3.remove(20)
print(l3)

#2.Write a Python program to demonstrate how changes in a list's alias affect both lists,
#  while changes in a cloned list do not.
l1=[10,20,30,40]
l2=l1
l3=l1.copy()
l2.append(4)
l3.append(5)
print(l2)
print(l3)

#5. Mathematical Operations:
#1.Create two lists of numbers, and use the + operator to concatenate them.
#Then, use the * operator to repeat the elements of one list 3 times.
s1=[1,2,3,4,5,6,7]
s2=[40,50,60,76]
print(s1+s2)
print(s1*3)

#2.Given a list of numbers, write a Python program to create a new list where each element is doubled
# (i.e., each element is multiplied by 2).
numbers=[2,3,4,5,6,7]
l=[x*2 for x in numbers]
print(l)

#6. Membership Operators:
#1.Write a Python program to check if a specific element (e.g., 5)
#  exists in a given list using the in operator. If it exists,
# print its position; otherwise, print "Element not found."
#Given a list of student names, check if "John" and "Sara" are in the list using the in operator.
a=["john","sara","srinu","gopi","ramkrishna"]
list_numbers=[1,2,3,4,]
exist_element=2
if exist_element in list_numbers:
    position=list_numbers.index(exist_element)
    print("element",exist_element ,"found at",position)
else:
    print("element not found")
names=["john","sara"]
for i in names:
    if i in a:
        position=a.index(i)
        print(i,"found at position:",position)
    else:
        print("element not found")

#7. Nested Lists:
#1.Write a Python program to create a 3x3 matrix (nested list) and print the matrix.
#  Then, access and print the element at row 2, column 3.
matrix=[[1,2,3],[4,5,6],[7,8,9]]
for i in matrix:
    print(i)
s=matrix[1][2]
print("element at row 2 and column 3:",s)

#2.Create a nested list representing a list of students' names and their respective grades.
# Write a Python program to print each student's name along with their grade.
students=[["saikrishna",96],["gopi",97],["sai",67]]
for i in students:
    name,grade=i
    print("name:",name,"grade:",grade)

#8. Advanced Challenges:
#1.Create a list of numbers from 1 to 20. Write a Python program to generate two separate lists:
#One containing only the even numbers.
numbers=list(range(1,21))
even_numbers=[i for i in numbers if i%2==0]
odd_numbers=[i for i in numbers if i%2!=0]
print(numbers)
print(even_numbers)
print(odd_numbers)

#2.Write a Python program that reads a list of integers and returns
# a new list containing only the unique elements (i.e., removing duplicates).
#Given a list of tuples representing (name, age), sort the list by age in ascending order
a=[1,25,2,3,4,5,60,64,7,64,8,9,64]
unique_elements=set(a)
students=[("sai",23),("gopi",24),("saikrishna",25),("sriram",12),("srinu",10),("ram",11)]
s1=sorted(students,key=lambda i:i[1])
print(unique_elements)
print(s1)
